-- Part 1: Creating the Schema

-- In pairs, developers will need to answer the following questions:
-- What data do you need to store in the backend of your project? How will this be stored?
-- USER ID
-- USER NAME
-- EMAIL
-- COUNTRY FROM
-- BIO

-- USER ID
-- COUNTRY COUNT

-- USER ID 
-- SAVED COUNTRIES

-- IN THREE TABLES USER_PROFILE, COUNTRY_COUNT, SAVED_COUNTRIES


-- What data will you need to query from your database based on your user’s interaction with your app?


-- In pairs, developers will need to create a .sql file to write their schema code as well as their query code.
-- Add a new .sql file called “database-schema.sql” to your project repo
-- Create the tables for your database in SQL commands
-- Create at least 3 rows of data for each of your tables.
-- Create the queries that your project will need in order to send data to the frontend.
